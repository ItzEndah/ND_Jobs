Collection of jobs converted to ND Framework.
This is still work on progress.

> [!WARNING]
> All of the server events to pay the player **do not** validate the client request as of now (except the DrugTrafficking job). 
> This could result in exploiters giving themselves as much money as they want by calling the event.  
> Use at your own risk.

I am not the author of these scripts. I simply converted them to be compatible with [ND Framework](https://github.com/Andyyy7666/ND_Framework). Below are the links for the original resources:  
- [PortCargo](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-standalone-order-preparation-delivery-job/1922803)
- [TrashCollector](https://forum.cfx.re/t/standalone-release-trashmaster-job/4049981)
- [FoodDelivery](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-delivery-jobs-no-need-for-job-system/221649) (modified to make it generic food delivery)
- [DrugTrafficking](https://forum.cfx.re/t/air-trafficking-drugs-job-trashmaster-job-redeaux-standalone/4072328) (modified to make deliveries on vehicles and not airplanes)
- [MailDelivery](https://forum.cfx.re/t/maildelivery-v1-0-2-standalone-mail-delivery-job-for-paleto-bay-grapeseed-and-sandy-shores-extra-esx-addon/168076)

> [!TIP]
> If you want a job compatible with ND Framework and with protection against possible exploited client events, check my latest release:
